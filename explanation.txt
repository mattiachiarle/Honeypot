For this assignment, the first goal was to establish a connection between the SSH client and the Paramiko server.
To accomplish it, I took inspiration from the following repository: https://github.com/internetwache/SSH-Honeypot.
This project allowed me to understand how to make Paramiko work and how I could use it to implement all the
requirements for the assignment.
My initial focus was on the authentication. After understanding that it relied on the function check_auth_password,
I implemented my logic to allow the login for the users in usernames.txt after 5 attempts. Once it was working, I
tried to understand how to allow a client-server communication through SSH. This was solved by exploiting channels.
Then, the most complex part probably was the creation of the fake shell. I had to perform many trials and errors
before finding a way of creating a fake shell by overwriting check_channel_shell_request and
check_channel_pty_request.
Lastly, I figured out how to implement a filesystem. Since it has only one level (i.e., we can't create directories),
I decided to use a dictionary, with key=filename and value=file content. The precise logic to handle the commands
can be found in the code comments.
